**Adventure in the House of Vladmond**

*This is Adventure in the House of Vladmond! A text-based adventure game where your job is to banish the evil vampire Vladmond. To do this, youâ€™ll need to find a cross as well as his coffin. Then you will need to use the cross to banish him.*

*You were at work when your neighbors called you to inform you that there is a power outage in your neighborhood. Because your workplace is close to your house, you immediately got into your car and went home to see what was going on. You unlocked the front door and started to see many weird things. You want to explore your house to see if there is anything weird going on.*

*To interact with the game, just write the name of anything you wish to inspect or take. You can also move between rooms by typing the direction you wish to go (e.g., forwards, backwards, upstairs, downstairs, or in one occasion, elevator). Additionally, you can open your inventory by typing `inventory` and type `help` for any further assistance.*

*Good luck!*
